          <h2>Military Park is Founded</h2>
          <p>The founders of Newark set aside a six-acre stretch that formed a triangle between Broad Street, Park Place, and Rector Street. It was initially referrd to as the "Middle Commons." In the 1700's it was referred to as the "Training Grounds" used for military training. And finally, "Military Park" from 1869 onwards.</p>

          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/u1q0WyL.jpg">
          <p>In 1733, Colonel Josiah Ogden was reprimanded by the First Church (a Presbyterian church) for breaking Sabbath by harvesting his almost spoilt wheat crop on a Sunday. Since the town was deeply religious, Ogden was outcast from the community and unhappy with the congregation of the First Church. Along with a small group of Episcopalians, Ogden established the Trinity Episcopal Church, Newark's second oldest church. The bitter feud between the First Church and the Second Church lasted until the Revolutionary War. George Washington was said to have attended services at this church as well. </p>

          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/q71JK71.jpg

          <p>Weston was a master electrician who's main focus was with dynamos (an electrical generator that produces direct current with the use of a commutator).  He worked through the 1870's on maximizing efficiency of the dynamos and debuted his dynamo powered electric lamps in 1876. He moved to Newark in 1877 and established himself by putting up his lamps on the watchtower of Newark's Fire Department which was in the town center. The publicity from those lamps led to the city of Newark ordering his lamps for Military Park, which was also the first municipal underwriting of electrical street lighting in the United States. Weston also later went on to light the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

          <p>The statue of the one-armed Civil War hero and Newark native was the first public sculpture placed in Newark. The statue was initially commissioned in 1873 by the State of New Jersey to be put on display in Statuary Hall located in Washington D.C.. However, the statue was found in the cellar of the State House in Trenton in 1879. Once found, a Civil War veteran committee arranged to move the statue to Newark. Ulysses S. Grant and George B. McClellan attended the dedication ceremony. Henry Kirke, also famous for the casting of the George Washington statue in Union Square casted the bronze statue.</p>

          <h2>Underground Parking Garage Added</h2>
          <p>Due to the increase of commuters in Newark, the city sought relief by constructing a multi-level parking garage capable of holding up to 1,030 cars. The construction required entrance and exit ramps, along with stair and elevator kisoks which interfered the natural landscape and location of the monuments. Due to this disruption, certain statues were repositioned to accommodate the new landscape.</p>
